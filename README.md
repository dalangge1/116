# GANs for Solving Inverse Problems
The test code for: "Adversarial Training for Solving Inverse Problems".

Author: zzhengxi@umich.edu

With this project, you can train a model to solve the following inverse problems:
- Separating superimposed images on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
- Image denoising on MNIST
- Removing speckle and streak noise in CAPTCHAs

All the above tasks are trained without any help of pair-wise supervision.


## Prerequisites

- python 3.5
- anaconda>=5.2
- opencv>=3.4
- tensorflow >=1.8


## Usage

Train:

    $ python igan.py

Test:

    $ python deploy.py 

Configurations:

    $ vi initializer.py 

## Results

#### A toy data

An illustration of the training process of our method on two groups of 2D data: 1) Gaussian data, and 2) Banana data. Our method aims to learn an invertible mapping (AfÔ¨Åne transformation) for each data point so that to map green cluster to the red and inversely map the red to the green.  No pair-wise supervision is provided during the training.

#### Separating superimposed images

Some example results of superimposed image separation by using our method on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. No pair-wise supervision is used during the training.

#### Breaking CAPTCHAs

Some example results of undetermined BBS for CAPTCHA images by using our method. No pair-wise supervision is used during the training.

Some example results of undetermined BSS for speech signals by using our method. Each audio CAPTCHA fragment consists of 4 random pieces of the human voice and is about 2.5 seconds long (8kHz). No pair-wise supervision is used during the training.

#### Denoising

Some example results of image denoising on MNIST images. Despite the strong noise (PSNR less than 0.01 dB), our method sill nicely recovers the clear image. No pair-wise supervision is used during the training.

#### Deraining

Some example results of image deraining with different methods on the [Image Deraining Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05957): [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN), and [Pixel-to-Pixel](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix) and Ours.
